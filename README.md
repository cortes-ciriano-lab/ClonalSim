# ClonalSim: A Python Wright-Fisher simulator for clonal expansions

ClonalSim is an object-oriented program that effectively simulates a Wright-Fisher model with selection. Specifically, it is used to calculate a clonal expansion where the number of mutant cells in each generation are drawn with binomial sampling. This code is being developed as part of the MSI evolution project.

Moreover ClonalSim can turn an array or matrix straight a python Tree object with nodes. Then, the user can use the class which is compatible with the treeswift python package for downstream analysis such as visualisation, editing etc.

## Functionalities
Main functionalities include:
1. Population class with features and a method inside to simulate Wright-Fisher
2. Transfer of an array population to a tree network with nodes, ready to import to the python treeswift package and versatile for further analysis.
3. Read in function for observed data from a tsv file or string.
4. Function to assign branch lengths based on a Poisson distribution with mean of a given mutation rate 
5.  Function to do averaging across the branch lengths of the tree before summary statistics

## Description of the code
#### Master Simulator Function that includes running the following:
Step 1:  Python class that initiates a population class with features and a simulation method

Step 2:  Function that runs a population simulation and returns population, figures, probabilities used in each generation

Step 3:  Function that from a population array create a dictionary of clusters which represent clades of the tree

Step 4:  Function that takes in a population array, turns it in a network of nodes and then to a tree object 
         compatible with the treeswift python package for further manipulaton in an efficient way

Step 5:  Function that assigns edge lengths to the simulated tree based on a Poisson distribution with mean Î¼

Step 6:  Function that calculates the Lineage Through Time plots and statistics for a simulated tree

Step 7: function that reads in the observed data in a treeswift tree and returns Lineage Through Time plots and statistics

### Dependencies

* python3, miniconda
* all miniconda libraries can be installed with 

```
conda env create -n ClonalSim --file ClonalSim.yml
conda activate ClonalSim

```

## Example Run for simulating data
```
python3 coloSim.py --N 2000 --generations 20 --mut_samples 60 --s 1.3 --mu 100
```
where N=population size, mu=mutation rate, mut_samples=number of mutant leaf nodes and s=fitness

## Example Code for reading observed data, calculating summary LTT and plotting
```
obs_tree = read_observed_data(obs_tree_path) # function that will read in the data to a tree class
obs_tree.draw()
normalise_tree_lengths(obs_tree) # normalise tree before LTT statistics
obs_tree.ltt()
```
